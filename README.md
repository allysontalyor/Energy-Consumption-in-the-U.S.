##Aims:

-	AIM 1: 	Analyze the energy consumption data between the dates of 1960-2017
-	AIM 2:  Look at the different types of energy consumption and draw a conclusion by understanding the changes in data
-	AIM 3: Understand the trends in energy consumption around the U.S. within each dataset from the U.S. Energy Information Administration
-	AIM 4: Utilize Analysis tools such as :  Python | JavaScript | Toast UI Chart | CSV | Json
-	AIM 5: Provide data on energy consumption around the U.S.

## Impact and Intended Results

According to eig.gov, in 2017 the  U.S. total primary energy consumption was about 98 quadrillion British thermal units (BTU), which was about 17% of the worlds 582 quadrillion British thermal units (BTU). The different types of unites include: 

-	Coal              
-	Motor Gasoline
-	Distillate Fuel Oil                
-	Jet Fuel       
-	Other Petroleum
-	Nuclear Electric Power	
-	Hydroelectric Power	         
-	Biomass
-	Natural Gas     
-	Net Electricity Imports
-	Net Interstate Flow of Electricity  
-	Other Renewables

Our goal is to provide data regarding energy consumption by using CSVs from: 
https://www.eia.gov/state/seds/seds-data-complete.php#CompleteDataFile


We will look at different states, dates, and types of energy used
